# Fernando feedback

## Module 1

### Introductions

Squeeze into first 5 minutes of module 1


### Table-setting

#### Hub provisioning

Log in to Hub **during** the introduction / presentation; sometimes can be a bit slow.


#### :check: Comms

If it gets stuck, summon Matt/Tasha for support with a red sticky.
When asked, please use a green sticky note to indicate a step is complete.
Raise your hand to interrupt speaker for a question!


## :check: Remove step 4: Collaborate!

Too much! Not enough time!


## Module 2

### Collaboration in JGIS

In pairs (one group of 3?)

Remember: Git is not aware of your collaboration.
The host will have to make the commits.

Two levels of collaboration: Jupyter's Google-docs-like collab, and Git layer which
syncs data to the website.

In Git, you can make multi-author commits, but that's beyond the scope today. The
commits will be owned by whomever typed `git commit` and `git push`.

Do not let users pick a dataset; don't give participants free will.
Give them a URL.

Include a solution notebook!


## Module 3

Switch pixi -> conda in the template repo

Switch to `myst init --gh-pages`

Explain: This was created with two commands `myst init --site`; `myst init --gh-pages`.
This is easy to do, but we can't risk doing it live with 55 people today ;)

References? Bibliography?

Show something more like a science paper --
https://github.com/fperez/agu-nnow-evaluation -- demo the complete example. Archived
with DOI on Zenodo

In Zenodo; have to manually add the PDF. They should really fix this! XD


## Next two hours

Try to build Leaflet in to the MyST Website.

Can it be done?

If not, we can emphasize the early stage of the tool and tell them they can't do it yet.
