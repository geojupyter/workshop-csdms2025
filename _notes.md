# Fernando feedback

## Introductions:

Squeeze into first 5 minutes

### Table-setting in the first module

Log in to Hub **during** the introduction / presentation; sometimes can be a bit slow.
If it gets stuck, summon Matt/Tasha for support.
When it's loaded, put up a green sticky note.
Raise hand to interrupt speaker for a question!


## :check: Remove Module 1 step 4: Collaborate!

Too much! Not enough time!


## Module 2 collaboration

Load everyone's data together!

In pairs (one group of 3?)

Remember: Git is not aware of your collaboration.
The host will have to make the commits.

Two levels of collaboration: Jupyter's Google-docs-like collab, and Git layer which
syncs data to the website.

In Git, you can make multi-author commits, but that's beyond the scope today. The
commits will be owned by whomever typed `git commit` and `git push`.

Do not let users pick a dataset; don't give participants free will.
Give them a URL.

Include a solution notebook!


## Module 3

Switch pixi -> conda in the template repo

Switch to `myst init --gh-pages`

Explain: This was created with two commands `myst init --site`; `myst init --gh-pages`.
This is easy to do, but we can't risk doing it live with 55 people today ;)

References? Bibliography?

Show something more like a science paper --
https://github.com/fperez/agu-nnow-evaluation -- demo the complete example. Archived
with DOI on Zenodo

In Zenodo; have to manually add the PDF. They should really fix this! XD

## Next two hours

Try to build Leaflet in to the MyST Website.

Can it be done?

If not, we can emphasize the early stage of the tool and tell them they can't do it yet.
