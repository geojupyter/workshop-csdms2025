title: "Communication"

In order to use our limited time efficiently, we ask that you use the following
communication patterns:


## âœ‹ Question!

Raise your hand at any time to ask a question -- interrupting the speaker is OK!


## ðŸŸ¥ Stuck!

Place a red sticky on your laptop display where we can see it if you are stuck or
need help.
We'll come and help you out, or we may ask you to
[join Zoom](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/98284176142?pwd%3DotjtnaYEdrMvt3YFWirjsLxKoRewQ1.1%26jst%3D2&sa=D&source=calendar&ust=1747152642202214&usg=AOvVaw1AnL74ZkvNO1mT8cOJiXS_)
for support.

If using Zoom, please share your screen and either speak quietly or type your
question/problem out in the chat.


## ðŸŸ© Ready to go!

We will sometimes ask you to use the green sticky to indicate that you've completed a
step.
