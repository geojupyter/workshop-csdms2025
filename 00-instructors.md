## [Fernando Pérez](https://fernandoperez.org/)

👋 I am faculty at UC Berkeley Statistics and Data Science, and a scientist at
LBNL.
I direct the Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS) and co-direct the Eric and Wendy
Schmidt Data Science & Environment Center (DSE).
I co-founded 2i2c.org and NumFOCUS.

Trained in physics, I build open source tools for science and education, having
created IPython and co-founded Project Jupyter.
My research focuses on open, reproducible science and scientific uses of AI for problems
in earth and the environment.


## [Tasha Snow](https://tsnow03.github.io/)

I am a Research Scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of
Maryland, and I am the co-founder of CryoCloud.

My research focuses on glacier and ocean interactions in Greenland and Antarctica using
satellite data. I also specialize in open-source science and machine learning.

In my free time I climb and do all of the outdoor sports, play board games, and try to
find the best food in town.


## [Matt Fisher](https://mfisher87.github.io)

👋 I am a Community Manager and Research Software Engineer at
[Schmidt Center for Data Science and Environment](https://dse.berkeley.edu/) at
[University of California, Berkeley](https://berkeley.edu).

My primary project right now is [GeoJupyter](https://geojupyter.org), an effort to
**reimagine geospatial interactive computing** to **enable more people to confidently
engage with geospatial data**.

🐶🌱🎶🎹🥁 I love dogs; plants and gardening; and music, especially playing keyboards
and drums!
