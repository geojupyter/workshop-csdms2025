### Accept the invitation to join the CryoCloud team

Once we have your github ID, we will send you an invitation to join the
[GitHub team](https://github.com/orgs/CryoInTheCloud/teams/csdms-2025-workshop)
that will give you access to log in to CryoCloud.
**You must accept that invitation!**

* [Click here to accept your invitation](https://github.com/orgs/CryoInTheCloud/invitation).
  You should see a simple page with a big green button to accept.
  If you don't, it's possible you already accepted your invitation, possibly by e-mail.
* [Log in to CryoCloud](https://hub.cryointhecloud.com/).
  If you see a "403 Forbidden" error, you don't have the correct access.
  Let a workshop organizer know, and give them your GitHub username, and we'll fix it
  right up!
