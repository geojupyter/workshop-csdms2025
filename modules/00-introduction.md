👋 I am a Community Manager and Research Software Engineer at
[Schmidt Center for Data Science and Environment](https://dse.berkeley.edu/) at
[University of California, Berkeley](https://berkeley.edu).

My primary project right now is [GeoJupyter](https://geojupyter.org), an effort to
**reimagine geospatial interactive computing** to **enable more people to confidently
engage with geospatial data**.

🐶🌱🎶🎹🥁 I love dogs; plants and gardening; and music, especially playing keyboards
and drums!
