title: "ðŸ’ª Exercise"

## Step 1: Open the example Jupyter Notebook for Module 2

1. In your repository, open `examples/module-2/example-2.ipynb`.
1. Explore! **Read and run the cells one-by-one**.


## Step 2: Complete the challenge in the notebook

The Notebook contains everything you need to complete step 2 of this exercise.


## Step 3: Collaborate!

1. **Close your Notebook from step 2**.
1. In step 2, you constructed a JupyterGIS project in a Jupyter Notebook.
   Now let's open that project directly.
   Open the file browser using the top icon in the left panel.
   Open `example.jGIS` by double-clicking it.
1. Share your JupyterLab session:
   * Click the "share" icon in the top-right.
   * Copy the URL.
   * Share that URL with the group.
       * Open the [workshop server browser](https://www.figma.com/board/JmA9uPUoWNrd4clVVZ1oxT/CSDMS-2025-GeoJupyter-Workshop---Server-Browser?node-id=0-1&t=6d5vtTt29NDI3aSY-1).
       * Follow the instructions on the board.
         (there are big arrows pointing at them!)
1. What observations can you make about this data?
1. Use annotations to record an observation on the map.
    * Right click anywhere, and select "Add Annotation".
1. Can you think of other datasets that might be interesting to visualize together?
   Check out our server browser (the ðŸ“– icon in the toolbar at the top of the map)
   and add some other datasets to your shared project.
    * Can you change the opacity of a layer?
      (NOTE: This option is in the "objects properties" pane, not in the symbology menu)
1. How does JupyterGIS feel?
   What feels like friction?
   What feels good?
   What is needed to make it better?
   We'd be SO thrilled if you'd
   [open an experience report](https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis/issues/new/choose)
   to share your thoughts.


## Step 4: Save our work to GitHub

```bash
git commit --all --message="Complete module 2"
git push origin main
```
