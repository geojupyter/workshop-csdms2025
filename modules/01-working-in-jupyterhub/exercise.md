## Step 0: Setup

### Step 0a: Log in to JupyterHub

1. **Visit <https://hub.cryointhecloud.com>**.
   You may want to bookmark this page!
1. **Select the last option, "Bring your own image"**.
    * Copy/paste `ghcr.io/geojupyter/geojupyter:latest` into the "custom image" field.
    * Leave "Resource Allocation" as default (1.9GB RAM).
1. **Click "Start"**!
    * It may take a moment for the server to start.
      When it's done, **place a üü© green sticky on the corner of your laptop screen**
      so instructors know you're ready!
    * If startup takes longer than a couple of minutes, **put up a üü• red sticky** and we'll
      take a look!


### Step 0b: Create and clone a new repository for this workshop's exercises

1. **Create a new repository in GitHub from our
  [workshop template repository](https://github.com/geojupyter/workshop-csdms2025-template)**.

    :::{figure} ../../assets/images/github-use-template.png
    Click the green "Use template" button in the upper-right, then select "create a new
    repository".
    :::

1. Leave most of the settings as default: your username should be the "owner", and the
   repo should be public. **Set the "Repository name" to
   `workshop-csdms2025-exercises`** -- this will make it easier for us to find it!

1. **In JupyterHub, clone the new repository you just created** from the template.
   We'll be working here from now on!
    1. Create a new tab in JupyterHub with the ‚ûï icon.
    1. Launch a terminal.
    1. In the terminal, **Run the command below, replacing `MY-USERNAME`
       with your GitHub account username**.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MY-USERNAME/workshop-csdms2025-exercises
    ```


### Step 0c: Set up GitHub authentication

In order to push changes from the JupyterHub to GitHub to save our work, you need
credentials.
Since the JupyterHub is a shared cloud service, saving credentials there can be
dangerous.
Therefore, we use a special tool,
[`gh-scoped-creds`](https://github.com/jupyterhub/gh-scoped-creds),
to limit this risk.

1. **Navigate to the newly cloned repository** in the JupyterLab file browser on the
   left panel.
    * If the left panel isn't open, click the topmost icon in the far left column.
1. **Enter the directory `examples/module-1`**.
1. **Open `00-START-HERE.ipynb`** (double-click).
1. **Follow the instructions** in the Notebook.

This configuration is valid for 8 hours.
If you need to refresh your access later, please re-do these steps.


## Step 1: Explore some example data

1. **Navigate to the `exercises/module-1` directory** in the JupyterLab file browser.
1. **Double-click the GeoJSON file `seec.geojson`** to view it with the JupyterLab viewer.
1. **Right-click the same GeoJSON file `seec.geojson`, and select "JSON"** to view the raw
   contents of the file in a structured way.

JupyterLab is about much more than Notebooks!
It's built to be an interactive computational tool that helps us think about problems.
As the Jupyter community grows, so do JupyterLab's capabilities, and it becomes a more
complete solution over time.
We'll explore some of the latest examples of this progress soon.


## Step 2: Read our example Notebook

1. **Open `example-1.ipynb`** by double-clicking it in the file browser in the left panel.
1. This notebook is pre-populated with some code.
   As you read, **run the cells** by pressing `SHIFT+ENTER`.
1. **Fill in the final "Challenge" cells of the Notebook to add more data to the GeoDataFrame.**
   Start with a location that is meaningful to you:
   Your favorite coffee shop?
   The shelter where you adopted your pet?
   The town where you grew up?
1. Run the final cells.


## Step 3: Save our work to GitHub

1. **Run the following commands in the terminal**:

    ```bash
    git commit --all --message="Complete module 1"`
    ```

    :::{warning} This step may fail!
    If you didn't complete the instructions in step 0c correctly, this command will
    fail.
    If it does, you need to tell Git your name and e-mail, then try again.
    **Git will print out the commands you need to execute to fix this problem**.
    :::

1. **Run the following command in the terminal**:

    ```bash
    git push --set-upstream origin main
    ```

You can now visit your repository to verify that it's been updated.
Looking at the time labels is the fastest way to confirm this.


## Done!

Put up a **üü© green sticky** to let us know you've completed the exercise.
